# CodeUSA-Deob
The modified 637 deob that connects to CodeUSA RSPS


### Primary features
- Support for loading 800+ content
- Supports the newer model header
- Supports 700+ animations 
- Supports 700+ item defs
- Supports OpenGL, DirectX and Software mode rendering

### Primary Bugs
- No support for loading over 65k models, anything over that returns -1

### Concerns 
- There are a lot of hard coded elements, i'd remove them; look around animations and npcs.
- The cache provided with this is very CodeUSA specific so I'd recommened get a fresh 637 cache and packing what you want
- This is not my fully refactored client, I need to find it on one of my usbs, I will commit updates as I go. 


### License 

All I ask is you retain the original notice of release, buy me a beer if you use this and we meet and provide some sort of acknowledgement to the client source you are using (i.e link back to this github) 


### Setup 

The client requires some specific server side code, I will be releasing that shortly, this will be updated then.
